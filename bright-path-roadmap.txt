To launch a basic fictitious infrastructure startup “Bright Path Infrastructure”, here’s a step-by-step guide that includes everything from purchasing a domain to deploying your infrastructure:

1. Purchase a Domain
Choose a domain registrar (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains).

Search for a domain name that fits your startup and is available.
Purchase the domain (make sure to also set up domain privacy for security).
Ensure you have access to the domain registrar's management panel for DNS settings.


2 . Set Up a VPC Network in AWS
Create a VPC: Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) within AWS to manage the networking of both public and private subnets.

Define CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

Set up public and private subnets across different availability zones for high availability.
Set up route tables and NAT gateways for routing internet traffic to private subnets.
Deploy EC2 Instances: You may need EC2 instances for running backend services (e.g., a Django or FastAPI app).
Configure Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Load Balancer: Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances.


3. Set Up Active Directory (Internal Management)
Launch an EC2 Instance with Windows Server: Set up a Windows Server EC2 instance in your private subnet.


Install Active Directory: Use Server Manager to install the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role.
Configure Domain Controller: Promote the server to a domain controller and configure it for managing internal staff.
Add Users and Groups: Set up organizational units (OUs) for employees and configure necessary groups and policies.


4. Set Up a Ticket System (Open Source)
Choose an Open Source Ticketing System: Consider tools like osTicket.

Set Up the Ticketing System: Deploy it in your AWS infrastructure (you can use EC2 or AWS Fargate for containerized deployment).
Integrate with AWS: Set up email notifications and integrate with your communication tools (like Slack or Microsoft Teams).


5. Set Up Monitoring
LibreNMS: To monitor switches and VMs, install LibreNMS, an open-source network monitoring tool.
CloudWatch: Set up AWS CloudWatch to monitor your EC2 instances, load balancers, and other AWS resources.
Set up Alarms: Set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify your team if there are any performance or security issues.


6. Set Up IT Asset Management
Deploy Asset Management System: Choose an open-source IT asset management solution such as Snipe-IT for managing hardware and software.

Integrate with Active Directory: For ease of management, you can integrate the asset management system with your Active Directory to automatically sync employee information.
Launch the Website: Ensure the website is live, secure, and accessible by testing the domain and SSL configuration.

Monitor System Performance: Use the monitoring tools you set up (CloudWatch, Graylog, LibreNMS) to continuously monitor the performance of your infrastructure.
Get Feedback: As your fictitious company grows, gather feedback on the systems in place and continuously improve them.
